# Homework 11 - Interactivity in your application

## Overview
For Homework 11 (HW11), this assignment builds upon the work completed in HW10 by adding enhanced interactivity to your React Native application. You will submit detailed wireframes, screen PNGs, a storyboard, and an interactive prototype hosted in Snack.

[Here is a link](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/93957/assignments/853512) to the homework assignment in Canvas.

## Submission Components

- **Storyboard PNG**: A visual representation of the major screens and navigation flow of the application.
- **Screen PNGs**: Screenshots for each completed screen.
- **Wireframe PNGs**: Comparison wireframes for each screen designed in the Snack editor.
- **Snack iFrame**: Embedding the code for your application's Snack to showcase the live interactivity.
- **Expanded Screen Descriptions**: Detail the added interactivity for each screen, including the management of state and reasons for state choices.

Refer to the project scaffold and grading rubric for detailed requirements.

## Tasks

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Create a New Snack**:
   - Initialize a new Snack for HW11, distinct from HW10.
   - Transfer components from HW10 to HW11 to avoid redundancy.

2. **Component Management**:
   - Store reusable components in the `./components` folder.
   - Use core React Native components and ensure proper styling with StyleSheets.

### Development Requirements

1. **Incorporate React Hooks**:
   - Utilize hooks such as `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, `useInterval`, and `useContext`.

2. **Async API Calls**:
   - Implement one or more asynchronous API calls using `FETCH` or a similar library.

3. **Navigation**:
   - Develop a navigation system allowing movement between screens.

4. **State Management**:
   - Opt for global state management using `useState` at the top level or establish a global context with `useContext`.

## Additional Information

- Download the project scaffold and update the QMD file with your content as required for HW11.
- Ensure all elements as described in the scaffold are included in your submission.
